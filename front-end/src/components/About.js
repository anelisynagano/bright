						“There are times in our lives when we have to realize our past is
						precisely what it is, and we cannot change it. But we can change the
						story we tell ourselves about it, and by doing that, we can change
						the future.” <br></br>( Eleanor Brown, The Weird Sisters). <br></br>
						<br></br>The contributions of women to the advancement of science,
						the improvement of society and the care of our communities have
						always been there. Too often they are forgotten or overlooked in
						history books. The statement may be silent, but the effect is loud:
						our children are still being raised with an internalised impression
						than men can achieve more than women. The goal of this website is to
						give women back their rightful place in history. We have selected
						just a few amongst many pioneers, and would love to receive
						contributions to grow our list. By playing a game of memory cards,
						we hope that you will learn about and remember the names and
						contributions of these pioneering women.
